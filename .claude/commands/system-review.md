# System Review

Perform a meta-level analysis of how well the implementation followed the plan and identify process improvements.

## Purpose

**System review is NOT code review.** You're not looking for bugs in the code — you're looking for bugs in the process.

**Your job:**

- Analyze plan adherence and divergence patterns
- Identify which divergences were justified vs problematic
- Surface process improvements that prevent future issues
- Suggest updates to persistent assets (CLAUDE.md, plan templates, commands)

**Philosophy:**

- Good divergence reveals plan limitations → improve planning
- Bad divergence reveals unclear requirements → improve communication
- Repeated issues reveal missing automation → create commands

## Inputs

You will analyze four key artifacts:

**Plan Command:**
Read this to understand the planning process and what instructions guide plan creation.
.claude/commands/plan.md

**Generated Plan:**
Read this to understand what the agent was SUPPOSED to do.
Plan file: $1

**Execute Command:**
Read this to understand the execution process and what instructions guide implementation.
.claude/commands/execute.md

**Execution Report:**
Read this to understand what the agent ACTUALLY did and why.
Execution report: $2

## Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Planned Approach

Read the generated plan ($1) and extract:

- What features were planned?
- What architecture was specified?
- What validation steps were defined?
- What patterns were referenced?

### Step 2: Understand the Actual Implementation

Read the execution report ($2) and extract:

- What was implemented?
- What diverged from the plan?
- What challenges were encountered?
- What was skipped and why?

### Step 3: Classify Each Divergence

For each divergence identified in the execution report, classify as:

**Good Divergence ✅** (Justified):

- Plan assumed something that didn't exist in the codebase
- Better pattern discovered during implementation
- Performance optimization needed
- Security issue discovered that required different approach

**Bad Divergence ❌** (Problematic):

- Ignored explicit constraints in plan
- Created new architecture instead of following existing patterns
- Took shortcuts that introduce tech debt
- Misunderstood requirements

### Step 4: Trace Root Causes

For each problematic divergence, identify the root cause:

- Was the plan unclear? Where? Why?
- Was context missing? Where? Why?
- Was validation missing? Where? Why?
- Was a manual step repeated? Where? Why?

### Step 5: Generate Process Improvements

Based on patterns across divergences, suggest:

- **CLAUDE.md updates:** Universal patterns or anti-patterns to document
- **Plan command updates:** Instructions that need clarification or missing steps
- **Execute command updates:** Validation steps to add to execution checklist
- **New commands:** Manual processes that should be automated

## Output

Save your analysis to: `.plans/system-reviews/{feature-name}-review.md`

```markdown
# System Review: {feature-name}

## Meta Information
- **Plan reviewed**: [path to plan]
- **Execution report**: [path to report]
- **Date**: [current date]

## Overall Alignment Score: __/10

Scoring guide:
- 10: Perfect adherence, all divergences justified
- 7-9: Minor justified divergences
- 4-6: Mix of justified and problematic divergences
- 1-3: Major problematic divergences

## Divergence Analysis

For each divergence:

**[Divergence Title]**
- **Planned**: [what plan specified]
- **Actual**: [what was implemented]
- **Reason**: [agent's stated reason from report]
- **Classification**: Good ✅ | Bad ❌
- **Root Cause**: [unclear plan | missing context | missing validation | repeated manual step]

## Pattern Compliance

- [ ] Followed codebase architecture
- [ ] Used documented patterns (from CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] Applied testing patterns correctly
- [ ] Met validation requirements

## System Improvement Actions

### Update CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Document [pattern X] discovered during implementation
- [ ] Add anti-pattern warning for [Y]
- [ ] Clarify [technology constraint Z]

### Update Plan Command
- [ ] Add instruction for [missing step]
- [ ] Clarify [ambiguous instruction]
- [ ] Add validation requirement for [X]

### Update Execute Command
- [ ] Add [validation step] to execution checklist

### New Commands Needed
- [ ] `/[command-name]` for [manual process repeated 3+ times]

## Key Learnings

**What worked well:**
- [specific things that went smoothly]

**What needs improvement:**
- [specific process gaps identified]

**For next implementation:**
- [concrete improvements to try]
```

## Important

- **Be specific:** Don't say "plan was unclear" — say "plan didn't specify which auth pattern to use"
- **Focus on patterns:** One-off issues aren't actionable. Look for repeated problems.
- **Action-oriented:** Every finding should have a concrete asset update suggestion
- **Suggest improvements:** Don't just analyze — actually suggest the text to add to CLAUDE.md or commands
